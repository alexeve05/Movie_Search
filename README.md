## Setup

For safety and practical use, the API key has been removed. In result, the project will not function until:

1. Create a free account at https://www.themoviedb.org/
2. Generate your API key
3. Open the script.js file
4. Replace "const API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"; " with your own API key
5. Open index.hmtl in your browser
